# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create an in-depth tool that presents UFO sightings across North America and allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Quick Start: How to use this site 
Load the initial page which will populate a html webpage with data summarizing UFO sightings in an organized table

Utilize the filter option to isolate data by city, state, country, or shape of UFO.

## Summary:
Drawback of this webpage
- The major drawbacks of this page is that the search bars will take in any type of input, regardless of whether it's present in the data or not. This can result in some negative end-user experience as they will get 0 results if there is a typo in their search criteria, their case doesnâ€™t match data, or date formatting is incorrect.

Recommendations for further development
- Add more features to the search boxes
	- Use REGEX to allow users to input city, state, country, shape without being case sensitive.]
	- Auto-populate available search terms in a drop down to make it easier for users to know what options are in the data.
